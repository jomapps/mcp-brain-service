## Release Notes

### Version 1.1.0 Highlights

This release adds powerful batch processing capabilities for automated gather creation workflows:

1. **Batch Operations**: Create up to 50 nodes in a single request with parallel embedding generation
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Find semantically similar content to prevent duplicates
3. **Context Aggregation**: Gather insights from previous departments with AI-powered theme extraction
4. **Coverage Analysis**: Identify gaps and get actionable recommendations using advanced LLM analysis

These features enable efficient, automated content generation workflows while maintaining high quality and avoiding duplication.

### Breaking Changes
None - All changes are additive and backward compatible.

### Migration Guide
No migration required. New endpoints are available immediately after deployment.

### Known Issues
- 2 contract tests have intermittent failures due to asyncio event loop issues in test environment (not affecting production)
- LLM operations may take 10-15 seconds depending on content size (expected behavior)

### Upgrade Instructions
1. Pull latest code from repository
2. Update environment variables (add OpenRouter and PayloadCMS configs)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Restart service: `pm2 restart mcp-brain-service`
5. Verify: `curl https://brain.ft.tc/health`
