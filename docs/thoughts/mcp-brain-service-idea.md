Perfect! I've created a comprehensive **brain-implement.md** document that gives you everything needed to build the MCP Brain Service in parallel with your Auto-Movie app.

## Key Features of This Implementation Guide:

### **üèó Complete Step-by-Step Build Process**
1. **Project Structure** - Organized Python service with proper module separation
2. **Configuration** - Environment-based settings with validation
3. **Core Services** - Jina v4 + Neo4j integration with caching
4. **MCP Protocol** - Full WebSocket server with tool registry
5. **Testing Framework** - Mock data and validation scripts

### **üìã Ready-to-Copy Code**
- **Configuration management** with Pydantic settings
- **Jina v4 service** with embedding generation and similarity search
- **Neo4j service** with vector indexes and graph operations
- **MCP tools** for character creation and semantic search
- **WebSocket server** with full MCP protocol support

### **üéØ Clear Success Milestones**
```bash
‚úÖ Milestone 1: Basic setup and dependencies
‚úÖ Milestone 2: Core services working (Jina + Neo4j)
‚úÖ Milestone 3: MCP server accepting connections/p
‚úÖ Milestone 4: Character operations with embeddings
‚úÖ Milestone 5: Production deployment at brain.ft.tc
```

### **üß™ Built-in Testing**
- **Connection testing** with WebSocket clients
- **Character creation** and similarity search validation
- **Mock data** for independent development
- **Integration testing** scripts ready

## Perfect for Parallel Development:

### **While Building Auto-Movie App:**
- **Different tech stack** (Python vs Next.js)
- **Independent testing** with mock data
- **No integration dependencies** during development
- **Clear API contract** defined upfront

### **Development Flow:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Auto-Movie development
cd auto-movie
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Brain service development  
cd mcp-brain-service
python run_dev.py

# Terminal 3: Test integration
python test_basic.py
```

## What You Get After Implementation:

### **Working Knowledge Graph Service**
- Create characters with personality/appearance embeddings
- Find similar characters using semantic search
- Project-scoped data isolation
- WebSocket MCP protocol for agent integration

### **Ready for Auto-Movie Integration**
```typescript
// Auto-Movie can immediately connect and use:
const brainClient = new MCPClient('wss://brain.ft.tc')
const similar = await brainClient.findSimilarCharacters(query)
```

The implementation is designed to be **production-ready** from the start, with proper error handling, logging, and deployment scripts.
