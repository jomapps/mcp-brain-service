# Feature Specification: MCP Brain Service

**Feature Branch**: `001-docs-thoughts-mcp`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "@docs/thoughts/mcp-brain-service.md has my plan for this app. pls also read @docs/thoughts/Domain-configs.md for reference"

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What is the data retention policy for character data when a project is deleted? ‚Üí A: Delete all associated character data immediately and permanently.
- Q: How should the MCP Brain Service handle a temporary outage of the Jina v4 embedding service? ‚Üí A: Reject incoming requests with an error indicating the service is unavailable.
- Q: What is the expected average response time for a semantic search query under normal load (p95)? ‚Üí A: 1min
- Q: Should character embeddings be updated if the character's description changes? ‚Üí A: Yes, automatically and synchronously update embeddings on every change.
- Q: What should be the system's behavior on its first-ever run? ‚Üí A: A and C

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer of the Auto-Movie app, I want to connect to the MCP Brain Service to create characters with personality and appearance embeddings, and find similar characters using semantic search, so that the main application can leverage a knowledge graph for rich character interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the MCP Brain Service is running, **When** the Auto-Movie app connects via WebSocket, **Then** a successful connection is established.
2. **Given** a connection is established, **When** the Auto-Movie app sends a request to create a character with specific traits, **Then** the character is created in the Neo4j database with corresponding Jina v4 embeddings.
3. **Given** characters exist in the knowledge graph, **When** the Auto-Movie app sends a semantic search query, **Then** the service returns a list of similar characters.

### Edge Cases
- During a Jina v4 service outage, the system MUST reject incoming requests with an error indicating the service is unavailable.
- How does the system handle invalid or incomplete character data?
- What is the behavior when a search query returns no results?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a WebSocket server implementing the MCP protocol.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST integrate with Jina v4 for generating embeddings.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST use a Neo4j database to store the knowledge graph.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST expose a tool to create new characters with personality and appearance attributes.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST expose a tool for semantic search to find similar characters.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST support project-scoped data isolation.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST be configurable for different environments (local, dev, prod) based on `Domain-configs.md`.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST permanently delete all character data associated with a project upon project deletion.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST automatically and synchronously update character embeddings whenever a character's description is modified.
- **FR-010**: On its first run, the system MUST initialize with an empty knowledge graph and perform a self-check to ensure connectivity to dependent services (Jina, Neo4j), reporting status.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The p95 response time for a semantic search query MUST be under 1 minute.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Character**: Represents a character in the story. Attributes include name, personality description, appearance description, and their corresponding embeddings.
- **Project**: Represents a container for data, ensuring isolation between different projects.
